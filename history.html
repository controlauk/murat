<p>
Yalova, located on the eastern coast of the Sea of Marmara, boasts a history stretching back thousands of years. Archaeological findings suggest that the area was inhabited during prehistoric times, with early settlements thriving due to its fertile land and mild climate. Over the centuries, it became home to the Phrygians, Bithynians, and later the Greeks, who valued its strategic position between Asia and Europe.</p>

<h2>Roman and Byzantine Influence</h2>

<p>
Under the Roman Empire, Yalova developed as an important agricultural and trade center. The Romans built roads, public buildings, and thermal baths, recognizing the healing properties of the region’s hot springs. During the Byzantine era, Yalova continued to flourish, serving as a peaceful retreat for emperors and nobles who enjoyed its natural beauty and therapeutic waters.</p>

<h2>The Ottoman Period</h2>
<p>
In the 14th century, Yalova became part of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans further developed the city, constructing mosques, markets, and public baths. The area’s thermal springs gained fame across the empire, attracting visitors from distant lands. Ottoman sultans frequently visited Yalova, considering it a perfect place for rest and recovery.</p>


<h2>Modern History and Atatürk</h2>
<p>
In the early 20th century, Yalova entered a new era with the founding of the Republic of Turkey. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, held a special affection for the city, calling it his “city of rest.” He had a mansion built here, which today serves as a museum, preserving his memory and visits to Yalova.</p>

<h2>Becoming a Province</h2>
<p>
Administratively, Yalova was once part of Kocaeli Province, and from 1930 to 1995 it belonged to Istanbul Province. In 1995, it was officially declared a separate province. Today, Yalova blends its rich history with modern life, offering visitors a unique mix of cultural heritage, natural beauty, and peaceful living.</p>
